The value of BUFFER_SIZE originates from the BUFSIZ constant in stdio.h and the libc crate to make stream IO efficient. In the latter the value is constantly set to 8192 on all platforms, where the value in stdio.h is determined on each platform differently. Since libc chose 8192 as a reasonable default the value here is set to this value, too."]],"struct":[["BytesChunk","A [`BytesChunk`] storing a fixed size number of bytes in a buffer."],["BytesChunkBuffer","An abstraction layer on top of [`BytesChunk`] mainly to simplify filling only the needed amount of chunks.
